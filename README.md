Hey everyone. I hope you are doing fine and well.

So this repository is created during my internship training in the institution. We are tasked together with my other intern colleague
to create a system-gateway for accessing all of the systems in the college. We created this using Vue.js with TailwindCSS for our frontend
and Nest.js with Google Authentication, since the school utilizes the Google Accounts and Microsoft Accounts (we're not fully integrating it yet). 

We ask for your help developers. To collaborate with us with our project. 

Thank you. Have a nice day ahead!

P.S. Sorry if my english is not good.
